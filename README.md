# Twitter-Activity-Predictor

This project is essentially about stopping "FAKE NEWS PROPAGATION". To elaborate on that a bit more, nowadays, there have been multiple cases worldwide, where a news, which has no credibility whatsoever, has travelled far and wide, and altered the thinking and opinions of people about certain events/person/organization.
This seemingly timid pactice can have a much more deep rooted impact than it lets on. It can mould the minds of people into believing what is fake. And that is exactly what this project stops (or, has tried to stop). 

In this repository, you can find all the data analysis (all authentic and experimental data) did for the project and may access it if you desire. Attached below is the Google Dive link to the entire dataset collected.
You will find information about 5 types of Twitter activites ---- 
* Login 
* Follow
* Favourite
* Retweet
* Bot (Data from a Bot exected activity)
Along with that, you will also find the keys that will be needed to decrypt the files labelled accordingly for easier access.
